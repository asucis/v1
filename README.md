# ASU CIS

Coalition of International Students is an organization dedicated towards helping international students on campus. We are part of the Council of Coalitions which is a council of seven identity-based coalitions that promote and represent the voice of various cultures within the Arizona State University.

**Our Mission**

CIS is a student led organization that acts as a bridge to reflect the needs of international students to university administration. We aim to enhance international student experience, promote cultural diversity and inclusivity in ASU through events and service.
